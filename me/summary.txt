My name is Venkata Naga Bhaskar Pothina. I'm an Software developer, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Visakhapatnam, Andhra pradesh, India.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
